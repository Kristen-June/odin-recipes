                <li>4 tablespoons ground flax</li>
                <li>1/2 cup water</li>
                <li>1/2 cup vegan butter, melted</li>
                <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
                <li>1 cup brown sugar, lightly packed</li>
                <li>1 tablespon pure vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1 cup all purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
                <li>1 cup non-dairy chocolate chips</li>
            </ul>       
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol class="lists box">
                <li>Make the flax eggs by stirring the ground flax and water in a small bowl. Set aside to thicken. 
                    Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line a 7 x 11 pan with parchment paper.</li>
                <li>Melt the vegan butter (earth balance brand preferred), and measure 1/2 cup. I do this by microwaving 
                    the vegan butter in a glass measuring cup, in 30 second intervals, until melted.</li>
                <li>In a large bowl, whisk the melted vegan butter and sugars together.
                    Add the flax eggs and vanilla, whisk until evenly combined</li>
                <li>Over the same large bowl, sift the flour and cocoa powder together.
                    Add the salt and baking powder and stir with a large wooden 
                    spoon until just combined, do not over mix</li>
                <li>Fold in falh of the chocolate chips. Pour the batter into the prepared
                    pan and smooth out the top with a spoon or yor hands. Sprinkle the rest of the 
                    chocolate chips on top of the batter.</li>  
                <li>Bake for 35-40 minutes. The brownies may still be bubbling and not
                    look done but they will firm up a lot as they cool</li>
                <li>Remove from the oven, allow to cool in the pan for 15 minutes, then pull the brownies out, using the parchment 
                    paper and let cool for another 15-30 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
